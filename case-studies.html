<h4>What is your business about? Why have you chosen to go distributed/cloud way?</h4>

    
    <p>Human Record is the marketplace for historic and vintage photos, illustrations, 
    and fine art. We serve the international community of historic image professionals 
    and passionate amateurs by providing an online platform for crowdsourced content 
    aggregation and straightforward licensing. </p>
    <p>We decided to build Human Record in 
    a distributed way because of two primary reasons. First, from an engineering perspective,
     we liked the reduced complexity and easier maintenance of a system based on loosely 
     coupled autonomous components. This type of architecture also facilitates scaling, 
     which is especially important for any web solution facing hard to predict workloads 
     and traffic. And second, from a business point of view, having a distributed system 
     running in the cloud has very tangible cashflow-related benefits: no upfront infrastructure 
     expenses, greatly reduced administration overhead, and flexible ongoing infrastructure 
     costs that can be easily scaled to fit the current demand</p>
    

    <h4>How long have you been using Lokad.CQRS? How do you find it?</h4>
    
<p>We have been using Lokad.CQRS for about 11 months now and absolutely love it.
 We started playing with the pre-v1.0 framework, and then integrated it with our 
 development codebase when the v1.0 was released. Our platform has been live for 
 5 months now and Lokad.CQRS has been a crucial component in the system. We were 
 holding back upgrading to Windows Azure SDK 1.4 until Lokad.CQRS v2.0 was released,
  but we upgraded recently and we are now running the latest versions.</p>
  
   <h4>Why does Lokad.CQRS work for you? What is you favorite feature? </h4>
  
<p>
Besides just working and taking away a great deal of complexity, Lokad.CQRS is an extensible
 and lightweight framework that incorporates best practices tested in the field by Lokad. 
 The extensibility and lightweight parts are very important to us and together with the rest 
 of the above features, Lokad.CQRS directly saves us development effort and costly, 
 time-consuming errors.
</p>
<p>
Being open-source, Lokad.CQRS has also served us as an engineering guidance in our 
cloud development. Important corollary of the open source code is that we can fix bugs 
and tweak the core of the framework any time we need to, as well as contributing back 
to the community. This also means that we are not introducing a blackbox as an important 
system component which further reduces the complexity of debugging code related to the 
framework.
</p>
<p>
Our favorite Lokad.CQRS feature is message handling, which is crucial in distributed 
systems. The framework takes away most of the complexity of transporting and 
dispatching messages within a distributed system and makes communication between 
decoupled components much easier.
</p>


<h4>How many people do you have working on CQRS related projects? </h4>
<p>Currently we have 3 developers working on the platform.</p>
<h4>What's their take on getting started with Lokad.CQRS, on documents and community?</h4>

<p>
 When starting  out with Lokad.CQRS,
 understandably there was a bit of a learning curve. I remember there was some
  confusion initially regarding the difference between the Lokad.Cloud and 
  Lokad.CQRS projects, but Rinat's blog is always a helpful resource in such cases. 
  The example projects are probably the fastest way for developers to get on track 
  with the framework, but the ones on Google Code could be improved. For example, 
  when we were upgrading to v2.0 not all example projects were updated to work with 
  the latest code. I guess it's hard for you to dedicate your limited resources to 
documentation and examples but if framework adoption is among your priorities, 
improving the help resources would help a lot of people to get started. Rinat 
is always very active and helpful, so kudos for having him aboard. 
</p>
<p>
Our developers also shared that they like the new v2.0 documentation PDF that
 gives a nice overview of the framework, but it's not a good substitue for the
  more hands-on wiki-style documentation that used to be on the Google Code site.
</p>

<h4>What's next for you? What role does Lokad.CQRS play in these plans?</h4>


<p>
We will continue to develop our platform and expand both our userbase and portfolio.
 This will lead us to new challenges and opportunities, but Lokad.CQRS will remain 
 an important foundation for our further growth.

        <blockquote>
        <p>Lokad.CQRS is damn near perfect at the moment. However, I think if you included
         the <em>DSL for generating messages</em>, that would remove a lot of friction.</p>
            
        <p>The most important thing for us right now, missing from Lokad.CQRS, is <em>Event Sourcing</em>. I've given it a shot with the new <em>TapeStorage</em> feature, but haven't had enough time to get it right.</p>


        <p>The next thing I would like to see is some sort of "real-world" sample.</p>
