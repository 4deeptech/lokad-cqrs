# Event Day

[EventDay](http://www.eventday.com/) is Conference Management Software, targeting in person conferences with attendance of 1000 or more.

This case study was provided by [Scott Cate](http://twitter.com/#!/scottcate), Regional Director at Microsoft and CTO working on EventDay. Development insights were shared by [Chris Martin](http://twitter.com/#!/cmartinbot), working deep in the trenches of the project.

## 1. What is your business about? Why have you chosen to go distributed/cloud way?

**Scott Cate**: We are an online event management company, that needs to scale up and down, depending on current volume.

## 2. How long have you been using Lokad.CQRS? How do you find it?

**Scott Cate**: I think we started looking at Lokad around August, 2010.

## 3. Why does Lokad.CQRS work for you? What is you favorite feature?

**Scott Cate**: It's CQRS, for Azure, with a brilliant code base. Saves us time from having to reinvent the wheel.

**Chris Martin**: I can't thank Lokad enough for the work you guys have put in. You have literally saved our startup thousands of man-hours!

## 4. How many people do you have working on CQRS related projects? What's their take on getting started with Lokad.CQRS, on documents and community?

**Scott Cate**: 1 or 2

**Chris Martin**: Lokad.CQRS is damn near perfect at the moment. However, I think if you included the _DSL for generating messages_, that would remove a lot of friction.

The most important thing for us right now, missing from Lokad.CQRS, is _Event Sourcing_. I've given it a shot with the new _TapeStorage_ feature, but haven't had enough time to get it right.

The next thing I would like to see is some sort of "real-world" sample. Perhaps porting _Mark Nijhof's_ sample.

EDIT: Just found _FarleyFile_ on github. I'll take a look at that. 

EDIT: ...your ES solution makes sense to me now.

_FarleyFile is the open source use case of Lokad.CQRS with DDD/ES that solves a real-world problem, while featuring some recommended practices and approaches. It is currently private, but is expected to be published in August/September with v3 of Lokad.CQRS._

## 5. What's next for you? What role does Lokad.CQRS play in these plans?

**Scott Cate**: Smaller, Better, Faster, Software. - and yes, we intend to use Lokad when we can.

## 6. Where can we find you online?

**Scott Cate**: We are building a public presence on [EventDay.com](http://www.eventday.com/)
